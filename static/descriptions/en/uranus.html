        <h5>General Characteristics and Atmosphere</h5>
        <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and one of the two ice giants in the Solar System. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with methane mixed in, which gives the planet its characteristic bluish-green color. Methane absorbs red light and reflects blue and green, creating the unique hue. Uranus has an unusual axis of rotation: the planet rotates "on its side," with an inclination of more than 90° to the orbital plane.</p>

        <h5>Water, Land, and Climate</h5>
        <p>Uranus is a gas giant with no solid surface, but the presence of water ice is assumed in its atmosphere. The planet has a very cold climate, with temperatures in the upper layers of its atmosphere around -224°C. Despite this, Uranus emits more heat than it receives from the Sun, indicating the presence of an internal heat source, possibly in the form of radioactive decay.</p>

        <h5>Rotation Axis, Orbital Motion, and Satellites</h5>
        <p>Uranus rotates around its axis in 17.2 hours. Its axis is tilted nearly 98° relative to the orbital plane, making its rotation unique in the Solar System. Uranus's orbital motion around the Sun takes 84 Earth years. The planet has 27 known satellites, including Titan, Oberon, Miranda, and Ariel. These moons are icy bodies that may exhibit geological activity.</p>

        <h5>Explorations and Features</h5>
        <p>Uranus was first explored in 1986 by the spacecraft Voyager 2, which flew past the planet. However, despite this, Uranus remains one of the least studied planets in the Solar System. Its unique axis of rotation and unusual atmospheric conditions make Uranus a subject of interest for future research.</p>
