        <h5>General Characteristics</h5>
        <p>The Sun is a star located at the center of our Solar System. It is the source of light and energy for all the planets, including Earth. The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and sustains nuclear reactions that produce vast amounts of energy.</p>

        <h5>Composition and Energy</h5>
        <p>The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen, which, through nuclear fusion, is converted into helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy. This energy is emitted as light and heat, which sustain life on Earth.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="description__block">
        <h5>Temperature and Core</h5>
        <p>The temperature on the surface of the Sun is about 5,500 °C, while at its core, where nuclear reactions take place, it reaches 15 million degrees Celsius.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="description__block">
        <h5>Rotation and Orbital Motion</h5>
        <p>The Sun rotates around its axis, but because it is not a solid object, the rotation period varies depending on latitude: about 25 days at the equator and up to 35 days at the poles.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="description__block">
        <h5>Role in the Solar System</h5>
        <p>The Sun is the center of the Solar System, providing gravitational pull that keeps the planets and other celestial bodies in their orbits. Without the energy from the Sun, life on Earth would be impossible.</p>
