        <h5>General Characteristics and Atmosphere</h5>
        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, often called Earth's "sister" due to its similar size and mass. However, Venus' atmosphere is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide, creating an incredibly strong greenhouse effect that leads to extreme temperatures on the surface — up to 465°C, which is hotter than Mercury despite Venus being farther from the Sun.</p>

        <h5>Water, Land, and Climate</h5>
        <p>Venus does not have liquid water. Its surface consists of volcanic mountains, plains, and craters. The climate is extremely hostile: temperatures are always high, and the atmosphere consists of thick clouds of sulfuric acid. There is no life on Venus, and the surface conditions are completely inhospitable, although there may be a potential for microorganism existence in the upper layers of the atmosphere.</p>

        <h5>Rotation Axis, Orbital Motion, and Satellites</h5>
        <p>Venus has an unusual rotation cycle: its rotation around its axis takes 243 Earth days, which is longer than its orbital period (225 Earth days). This means that a day on Venus is longer than a year. Venus also rotates in the opposite direction compared to most planets in the Solar System (retrograde rotation), making it unique. Venus has no natural satellites.</p>

        <h5>Explorations and Features</h5>
        <p>Venus has been explored by numerous space probes, including the Soviet "Venera" missions, which landed on its surface and transmitted data. However, the high temperature and pressure on the planet's surface make it difficult for further exploration. Modern missions, such as NASA's "VERITAS" and ESA's "EnVision," will continue studying Venus in search of new data about its geology and climate.</p>
