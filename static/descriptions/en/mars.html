        <h5>General Characteristics and Atmosphere</h5>
        <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, known for its reddish hue caused by the oxidation of iron in the soil. Mars' atmosphere is mostly made up of carbon dioxide (95%) and is very thin. It cannot support life like Earth and does not protect from solar radiation.</p>

    <div class="description__block">
        <h5>Water, Land, and Climate</h5>
        <p>Mars has an extremely dry surface, but in the past, it likely had large reserves of water. Today, water mainly exists as ice, and the planet's climate is cold and dry, with significant temperature fluctuations.</p>

        <h5>Rotation Axis, Orbital Movement, and Moons</h5>
        <p>Mars rotates around its axis in 24.6 hours, which is very close to an Earth day. The planet's orbital period is 687 Earth days, making a Martian year almost twice as long as an Earth year. Mars has two moons — Phobos and Deimos, which are much smaller and lack an atmosphere.</p>

        <h5>Future Research and Possible Colonization</h5>
        <p>Mars has attracted the attention of scientists as a potential place for colonization in the future. There are projects to explore the planet, including studying its underground resources and searching for possible signs of past life.</p>
