        <h5>General Characteristics and Atmosphere</h5>
        <p>Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, previously considered the ninth planet of the Solar System. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union redefined the classification of planets, removing Pluto from the list. It is now officially classified as a dwarf planet. Its thin atmosphere is mostly composed of nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide. The surface temperature is extremely low, reaching -229°C.</p>

    <div class="description__block">
        <h5>Surface and Climate</h5>
        <p>Pluto has an icy surface with mountain ranges, icy plains, and fractures. Its climate is characterized by extreme temperature fluctuations due to its elliptical orbit, leading to the temporary evaporation and freezing of its atmosphere.</p>

        <h5>Rotation Axis, Orbital Movement, and Moons</h5>
        <p>Pluto rotates around its axis in 6.4 Earth days, and it takes 248 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. Its largest moon, Charon, is so large compared to Pluto that they form a binary system.</p>

        <h5>Research and Significance</h5>
        <p>Pluto was studied by the "New Horizons" spacecraft in 2015, which revealed many details about its complex geology and icy atmosphere. Despite its exclusion from the planet list, it remains an important object of study in astronomy.</p>
