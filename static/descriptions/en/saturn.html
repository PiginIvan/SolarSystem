        <h5>General Characteristics and Atmosphere</h5>
        <p>Saturn is the second largest planet in the Solar System, known for its magnificent rings. The atmosphere of Saturn is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of methane and ammonia. Saturn is a gas giant with no solid surface, and its atmosphere is extremely thin. The planet has immense gravity, which influences its moons and rings.</p>

        <h5>Water, Land, and Climate</h5>
        <p>Saturn has no liquid water on its surface, but water ice is believed to exist in its atmosphere. The planet is also famous for its beautiful rings, which are primarily made of ice particles and rocks. The climate on Saturn is extremely cold, with temperatures reaching -178°C. Strong storms are observed in the planet's atmosphere, some of which can last for decades.</p>

        <h5>Rotation Axis, Orbital Movement, and Moons</h5>
        <p>Saturn rotates around its axis in 10.7 hours, which is very fast for such a large planet. Its orbital period around the Sun takes 29.5 Earth years. Saturn has over 80 known moons, with the largest being Titan, Rhea, Enceladus, and Mimas. Titan, Saturn's moon, is the only moon in the Solar System with a dense atmosphere and possible conditions for life in the form of organic molecules.</p>
