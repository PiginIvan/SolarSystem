        <h5>General Characteristics and Atmosphere</h5>
        <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. It has almost no atmosphere, and its composition mainly consists of particles such as oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen, but in such small quantities that it cannot support life. As a result, the temperature on Mercury fluctuates from extremely high values to very low ones depending on the day and night.</p>

        <h5>Water, Land, and Climate</h5>
        <p>Mercury has no liquid water, but there may be hidden ice in some craters at its poles. The planet is entirely made of solid surfaces and rocky materials. The climate is extreme: during the day, the temperature can reach 430°C, while at night, it can drop to -180°C.</p>

        <h5>Rotation Axis, Orbital Movement, and Moons</h5>
        <p>Mercury rotates around its axis slowly, with one rotation taking 58.6 Earth days. Because of this, its day lasts almost twice as long as its year. Mercury's orbital period around the Sun is just 88 Earth days, making its year the shortest in the Solar System. The planet has no natural satellites.</p>

        <h5>Research and Features</h5>
        <p>Mercury remains one of the least studied planets. Due to its proximity to the Sun and the extreme conditions for observation, studying this planet presents significant challenges. Currently, NASA is exploring Mercury with missions such as "MESSENGER" and "BepiColombo."</p>
