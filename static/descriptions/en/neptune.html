        <h5>General Characteristics and Atmosphere</h5>
        <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a massive atmosphere mainly composed of hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane. Methane gives Neptune its characteristic blue color by absorbing red light. Neptune's atmosphere is very active and unstable, with powerful storms such as the Great Dark Spot occasionally forming on its surface.</p>

        <h5>Water, Land, and Climate</h5>
        <p>Neptune has no solid surface and consists mainly of gases and liquids such as water ice and ammonia. While the planet does not have oceans, water ice may exist in its atmosphere. Neptune's climate is one of the most extreme in the Solar System, with very low temperatures and powerful winds that can reach speeds of up to 2,100 km/h.</p>

        <h5>Rotation Axis, Orbital Movement, and Moons</h5>
        <p>Neptune rotates around its axis in 16.1 hours, which is quite fast for such a large planet. Neptune's orbital period around the Sun takes 164.8 Earth years. The planet has 14 known moons, with the largest being Triton. Triton has an unusual orbital movement, rotating around Neptune in the opposite direction of the planet itself, suggesting that it may have been captured by Neptune.</p>

        <h5>Research and Features</h5>
        <p>Neptune was first studied up close during NASA's "Voyager 2" mission in 1989. Since then, the planet has remained one of the most distant and least explored in the Solar System. Neptune attracts the attention of scientists interested in gas giants, their atmospheric processes, and moons.</p>
